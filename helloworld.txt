yeah i see that
its like google docs but for ultra nerds
i made the terminal read-write now


yo :D

at the same time? yeah, you can keep typing. yep lol

yeah exactly lmao

yeah i ran git on it i know how to push and shit
dotfiles is the default lewagon stuff
add commit then push
learned that from odin
how do i find the new repo you just created
yeah origin master and stuff
oh i see it gh gave you the help page
i am familiar with bash from high school but this zsh shit is killing me
do we have to use this
i can learn but just unfamiliar with it
oh i got you
no i did it
accidentally killed the wrong terminal
here is a new one




what don't you understand about zsh?
zsh is basically bash + extra features. You should be able to run bash commands as well.able
-> i know i can run neofetch and shit on it
I lost your terminal btw, 1 sec.

i am listening
cant see the git_test repo on ls tho


You have to link this repo to that terminal using:

git remote add origin

You have to paste the whole thing, like git@github.com:asilliaahmet/gh_test.git

ohhh
ohhh
i get it now
git remote add o
git remote add origin git@github.com:asilliahmet/gh_test.git

also
you're in the wrong folder :D

do it now

i think we are trying to start a repo inside a repo here
